    <p>
      It's 04:00 AM. The sound of raindrops falling on top of the train’s roof would be a winsome invitation for an
      unconcerned night of sleep in the comfort of the seats encased in crimson velvet, and it indeed was for most
      people in that voyage, but not for two gentlemen sitting across from each other, both fully awake. Each seemed to
      be reading something. One of them had a newspaper in hands while the other had a book.<br>
      After a few hours of complete silence in the train wagon if not for the snores of fast asleep passengers, one of
      them decided to break the ice.<br>
      “You’re Italian, right?”, he said, showing the news in the newspaper. “Did you know the war with Ethiopia just
      ended?”<br>
      The other man stopped his reading and, with his glaring golden eyes, looked over his reading glasses, which seemed
      too small for his face. He seemed surprised.<br>
      “Yes, I did and yes, I am”, He responded, “You figured it because of the bible?”. He said while showcasing his
      book, which had the words <i>‘La Sacra Bibbia’</i> in golden letters engraved on a black leather cover.<br>
      “Indeed”, the man responded back and then immediately backed away. “I’m sorry! Did I disturb your reading?”<br>
      “I wasn’t really reading”, the Italian man clarified. “I was looking for a specific text, but couldn’t remember
      where it was”.<br>
      He then looks at the man sitting besides him, who’s peacefully sleeping with his head tilted backwards. “<i>He</i>
      would know exactly where it is, but I don't want to wake him up”.<br>
      “I wish I could help”, the newspaper man added. “I’m not really a religious person. Oh, how rude of me! I didn’t
      ask for your name”<br>
      <img class="jusep" src="other images/Giuseppe.png">
      “Its Giuseppe, Giuseppe di Vario”<br>
      “Mine’s Elijah Smith”<br>
      As they shook hands, Giuseppe side-eyed the window; the view was oddly familiar. The same trees, the same cliffs,
      even the same animals doing the same motions. It was not the first time Giuseppe had noticed it. It was like the
      train was going in endless circles, and Giuseppe was starting to get suspicious about the <i>ouroboros</i>-like
      pattern reality seemed to suddenly acquire.<br>
      “So, Elijah, sir”, Giuseppe leaned back, resting his back on the seat and clasping his hands together “What do you
      do for a living?”<br>
      “Oh, I work on finances” he responded eerily quickly. One could think he already expected such a question and had
      the answer at the tip of his tongue.<br>
      “How interesting” responded Giuseppe back. “Lot’s of people say I look like I work in finance. It’s very specific,
      I know, but many that know me say I would be good at it, to the point that I even considered it at some point”<br>
      Giuseppe looks at the window again, the view doesn’t seem to be the same. Could he be just hallucinating? Giuseppe
      is usually more resistant to sleep deprivation than that. He pulls his sleeve to look at his watch, only to not
      find him on his wrist. He could swear it was there only moments ago.
      “Um… Looking for that?” Elijah points at the watch, gently resting in the seat next to the sleeping man besides
      Giuseppe. “You took it off a few minutes ago. Here”<br>
      Elijah does the same motion and looks at his own watch. “Its 4:00 AM. Maybe you need a little bit of sleep”<br>
      “No, i don’t think i do”, Giuseppe says, locking his eyes on the man, who seems nervous all of a sudden, putting
      his hands on his pockets.<br>
      “I-i’m sorry” Elijah says, dodging eye contact “I didn’t mean to make assumptions about your sleeping
      schedule”.<br>
      “Oh, don’t worry about it. I don’t have the most normal sleep schedule. I wouldn’t say I have one at all.”
      Giuseppe looked back at the windows. “Look at those cows. They’re neither diurnal nor nocturnal animals. They’re
      <i>cathemeral</i>. Do you know what this is?”<br>
      “No… never heard of this word in my life”.<br>
      “Cathemerality is when an animal doesn’t have any set time for sleeping, but rather is awake anywhen he needs to
      eat, socialize, or any other activity.” Giuseppe explained “Cathemeral animals usually sleep 4 to 6 times a day,
      taking shorter naps. That’s why you see so many cows awake this late into the night.”<br>
      Giuseppe started to notice the background changing again, as if reality came to its senses and realized time
      should flow forward.<br>
      “That’s all very interesting, Mr. Giuseppe. Are you a naturalist of sorts?” Elijah asked. His voice had, for some
      reason, a certain nervousness.<br>
      “I do consider myself something along those lines but, if your question is whether or not I work with animals, the
      answer is no” Giuseppe explained. Elijah started to notice Giuseppe rarely ever looked into his eyes. During these
      last words he was always looking out into the window. “I do love animals, and we have a cat at home, but anything
      beyond that would be difficult to balance with my work.”
      Giuseppe kept looking at the window, but he also noticed the rain seemed louder, as if trying to distract his ears
      from something.<br>
      “You would know a lot about that, right…?” Giuseppe asked “…Having trouble balancing tasks”.
      “W-what do you mean, sir?” Elijah asked, avoiding eye contact. “I-i mean, you barely know me don’t go out
      mak-”<br>
      “You think I didn't notice we’re the only ones in this carriage?” Giuseppe side eyed Elijah, looking straight into
      his eyes, with his face still pointing towards the window. He squinted his eyes while his amber irises emitted a
      golden glow. “You can’t make the view convincing and keep the passengers snoring, do you?”.<br>
      Giuseppe stood up; the 188cm man's head almost touched the ceiling of the relatively short train carriage. He
      looked at this “Elijah” he had been entertaining and slowly walked towards him, closing the already small gap
      between their seats.<br>
      “Look, sir, I don't know what you are talking about…” Elijah said. Giuseppe kept walking.<br>
      “The carriage never had any other passengers!” He said. Giuseppe kept walking.<br>
      “Sir, if you don’t back off now i’m gonna have to call the guards” He warned. Giuseppe kept walking, but he never
      seemed to get any closer. As soon as he noticed this…<br>
      <i>snap</i><br>
      A golden cloud surrounded Giuseppe, shaping itself into an arm, floating above Giuseppe’s shoulder as if connected
      to his body, holding Elijah's neck and raising his body off the seat. It was golden and white and had what seemed
      like a ring made of golden light floating around its wrist.<br>
      Giuseppe took off his reading glasses as the skin of the man in front of him, being choked by this spectral hand,
      started to peel off in small chunks, like dry ink in a wall, revealing underneath a humanoid being with a dark
      void for a face surrounded by long rotten teeth that formed a spiral going into the void. It was skinny like a
      starved child, with the outline of its bones visible through its skin. Its nails were long and sharp, like the
      ones you would see in a movie witch, and it screeched in agony like an animal in a slaughterhouse.<br>
      “Its been a while since I've seen one of <i>these</i>”, Giuseppe said, holding the creature as it struggled to get
      off his grasp. Reality started to collapse around them, no longer being held together by the demon.<br>
      A dark glow emanated from the creature’s face’s abyss, almost like a shadow. “YOU WILL DIE, EXORCIST” The demon
      shouted. Its voice echoed as if the unending vacuum in its face acted as a chamber.<br>
      “May the Lᴏʀᴅ receive me when i do” Giuseppe said, as cross-shaped knuckleduster appeared in his hand.<br><br>
      “YOU WILL REGRET T̷H̷I̶S̸ Y̵͎̅O̷͍͠Ú̸ͅ ̴̙͊͗W̵̛͕͋ͅILL R̴̨̡͔̒͑̊E̶̝̳̊́G̸̻̥͚̯͒Ṛ̵͗̊͛̚͝E̷̦̘̞̟̲̅͋́̽̕̚Ț̵̚͜

      Giuseppe clenched his fist.<br>
      Golden light forming a four-pointed star encapsulated his fist as he released a powerful blow, going through the
      demon’s chest.<br>
      Giuseppe opened his eyes to the sunlight passing through the window of the train carriage. He took a look at his
      watch; it was 9:00 am. There was no one sitting across from him.<br>
      “Oh mio Dio, Giuseppe! Your nose is bleeding” a calm voice said. Giuseppe looked at the direction it came from. A
      man with a fancy moustache holding a cane. He wore white butler gloves with strange symbols, similar to alchemical
      circles from the middle ages, patched in gold on the back. “You didn’t even use it this time”<br>
      “I did” said Giuseppe “I was attacked by a <i>Nightmare</i>. Had to use it in a dream”<br>
      “Caspita, Giu! Each day your name as the <i>demon magnet</i> becomes truer!” this man said, already taking a small
      piece of fabric out of his pocket to clean the nosebleed “Here, let me clean-”<br>
      “Giacomo!” Giuseppe interrupted “You don’t need to worry about me. Plus, all in a night’s work, we’re exorcists.
      If anything, it helps our job to have swarms of demons coming after us”<br>
      Giuseppe took the cloth and cleaned the nosebleed himself as he stood up and they walked out of the train and into
      the train station.<br>
      “You know it’s all in a <i>day's</i> work, right?” Giacomo said with a smug demeanor and equally smug
      countenance.<br>
      “I’m aware, but I prefer it the way I said” Giuseppe said, doubling down on his mistake<br>
      “As long as you know you’re wrong, I’m content with it” He said as they left the trainstation.<br>

    <p>
      The sunny morning after a full night of rain had a distinct aroma; the Sun rays phased through the leaves of the
      trees; the temperature, even though it was summer, was colder than what Giuseppe and Giacomo were accustomed to in
      Venice. Not that it bothered them; it wasn’t their first time in the British Isles. At this point, there wasn’t a
      single European country yet to have their feet set on.<br>
      Even then, this was their first mission as the newly founded <i>Wings of Order</i> – or <i>Ałas dełe Ordene</i>,
      as is written on their sign back in Italy – after they left their previous guild.<br>
      They are in a carriage, heading to a mansion in Bristol from which they’ve received a letter:
    </p>

    <div class="flip-card">
      <div class="flip-card-inner">
        <div class="flip-card-front">
          <img src="other images/letter-front.png" alt="letter1" style="width:300px;height:450px;">
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <img src="other images/letter-back.png" alt="letter2" style="width:300px;height:450px;">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    </br></br>

    <p>
      “Don’t you think this is suspicious?” Giacomo asked while holding the letter, in Italian, as to not be understood
      by the coachman. “There are plenty of guilds here in England. Why would he contact us?”<br>
      Giacomo seemed to be enjoying the ride, looking away into the passengers and houses.<br>
      “I do”, Giuseppe affirmed. His demeanor seemed way less interested in his surroundings. “And that’s exactly why I
      put it so high in our priority list. This man claims to know Sarah, he could have information on what happened to
      her”<br>
      “If he does, wouldn’t he mention it in the letter?”<br>
      “Maybe, but we don’t know all the details. Perhaps he doesn’t know about her disappearance, and she told him about
      us even before that”. Giuseppe pointed at the letter before extending his arm.<br>
      “That’s a very specific scenario”. Giacomo handed it to him<br>
      Giuseppe took a good look into the letter. The movement of his eyes didn’t indicate he was reading through the
      letter, instead focusing on a specific part.<br>
      “The Nightmare”, Giuseppe said. “It used this name. Of all the names it must’ve found in my head, why this
      one?”<br>
      “Could just be recency bias”, Giacomo responded<br>
    </p>

    <img class="scene-divider" src="other images/AIANW Scene Divider.png">

    <p>
      Lying on the floor, Giuseppe was, in that moment, taken to a memory of his childhood:<br>
      “<i>Signor Vito</i>” said little Giuseppe all those years ago.<br>
      “Yes, Giuseppe” – Vito responded, sitting beside him in the fountain in front of the cathedral.<br>
      “What am I?” the kid asked – They told me I was special, but you told me and Francesco we were all special in the
      eyes of God. Am I <i>more</i> special?”<br>
      “Well… not quite, no” Answerd the reverend. “you’re special in a different way”<br>
      Giuseppe paused for a moment to reflect; “This doesn’t make any sense!” he frustratingly said. Reverend Vito
      laughed.<br>
      “Alright, let me explain; you know how I call you a little angel?”<br>
      Giuseppe nodded<br>
      “In a way… You really are. You see, humans have souls, and like some things are made out of stone or wood, and our
      bodies are made of flesh and blood; our souls are made of <i>Æther</i>…”<br>
      And as Giuseppe recovered his vision, being pulled out of this memory; as the bone monstrosity towered over him,
      Vito’s words continued to echo in his mind:<br>
      “... But<i> your</i> soul is not made of the same Æther souls are typically made of…”<br>
      And as he stood up, holding his bleeding shoulder with his other arm, a golden mist emanated from his body,
      creating a cloud that thundered harmonically like a choir of storms, with golden lightning rapidly forming and
      dissipating.<br>
      “…<i>your soul is made of the same æther angels are</i>”<br>
      The exorcist’s eyes locked with the creature. The golden cloud started shaping itself into a more structured form;
      first forming a pair of arms, with golden luminous rings floating around its wrists. Then a pair of legs that
      Giuseppe used to help him stand and a torso with sacred symbols engraved on its chest. Then a head; it didn't have
      a mouth, but it did have golden eyes, luminous hair and what seems like a small replica of Giuseppe’s reading
      glasses. Lastly it grew an enormous pair of snow white wings.
